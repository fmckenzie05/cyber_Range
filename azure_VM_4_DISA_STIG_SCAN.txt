Compliance: Disa Microsoft Windows 11 STIG v2r5
Lessons Learned - DISA STIG Compliance Scanning

Understanding STIG Hierarchy
STIGs follow a structured naming convention (v2r5 = Version 2, Release 5). Always verify you're using the current release since DoD updates these regularly. Outdated STIGs won't meet current compliance requirements.

Policy vs. Reality Gap
Many default Windows installations fail 50-70% of STIG controls out-of-the-box. Hardening takes deliberate configuration, not just patching. This is why automated scanning is critical.

Documentation is Evidence
For government contracts, compliance isn't just about fixing issues - it's about proving you fixed them. Tenable's reports become audit artifacts. Save baseline scans, remediation scans, and track changes over time.

Password Policies Hit Users Hard
STIG password requirements (14+ chars, complexity, 60-day rotation) often clash with usability. In production environments, expect pushback and plan user training. In your lab, this is less critical but good to understand.

STIGs Apply to More Than Just Windows
DISA publishes STIGs for databases, applications, network devices, and cloud platforms. Understanding one STIG helps you learn the framework for all of them.

Compliance ≠ Security
Passing STIG checks is necessary for DoD contracts but not sufficient for complete security. It's a baseline, not a ceiling. Combine with vulnerability scanning, pen testing, and threat hunting.
